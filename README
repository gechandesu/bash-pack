Handy Bash scripts

Installation
============

I recomend install scripts into the home directory. Place they into `~/.local/bin`. If you don't have it, create it:

    $ mkdir -p ~/.local/bin

Give executing rights for scripts:

    $ chmod +x <script_name>

Check your PATH variable:

    $ echo $PATH

If you don't find `/home/your_username/.local/bin` run:

    $ echo 'export PATH+=:$HOME/.local/bin' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc

Done. Run `<script_name> --help` for check.
